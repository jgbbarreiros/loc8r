# Getting MEAN
###### with Mongo, Express, Angular and Node

This is a book I'm reading where we build a full stack app called loc8r

## loc8r

> "Loc8r will list nearby places with WiFi where people can go and get some work done. It will also display facilities, opening times, a rating, and a location map for each place. Visitors will be able to submit ratings and reviews."
